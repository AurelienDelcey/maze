# 🧩 JavaFX Maze

A maze game developed in **Java** using **JavaFX**, created as a learning project to strengthen my skills in
algorithmic logic, grid-based structures, and clean separation between game logic and UI.

## 🎯 Project goals

- Practice **2D grid manipulation**
- Implement a **procedural maze generation**
- Handle **player movement with keyboard input**
- Improve **JavaFX architecture** (logic vs UI)
- Build a project suitable for a **developer portfolio**

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java
- JavaFX
- FXML
- CSS

## ✨ Features

- Procedurally generated maze
- Keyboard-controlled player
- Collision handling (walls / boundaries)
- Modular and extensible code structure
- Clear separation between:
  - Maze generation logic
  - Game state
  - UI rendering

## 🧠 What I learned

- Designing algorithms for grid-based systems
- Structuring a Java project beyond simple exercises
- Managing state and movement logic cleanly
- Avoiding tight coupling between UI and core logic
- Thinking in terms of scalability and future features

## 🚧 Work in progress

This project is still evolving. Planned improvements include:
- Different maze sizes
- Maze regeneration
- Optional automatic maze solver
- Visual enhancements

## ▶️ How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in an IDE (Eclipse / IntelliJ)
3. Make sure JavaFX is properly configured
4. Run the main application class
